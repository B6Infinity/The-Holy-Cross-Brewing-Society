- "corvo coffee" should be replaced by "The Holy Cross Brewing Society" and our logo
- instead of the main photo, a carousel of several photos from Google maps
- Put any other neutral font instead of the one they already have
- "cafe in Frankfurt" instead of "cafe in New York Open today until 7:00 PM" 
- put only our instagram in the contact us field - https://instagram.com/the_holy_cross_brewing_society?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=
- Color design repeats the color of the logo (all inscriptions and so on must be black), The background is up to you, as long as it's dark too!

This is a business card site 
 
An additional request - the result should not be an exact copy of the original site. Some details you can change at your discretion 

I want to get the final files of my site, which will then be installed on the hosting and connected to the domain. You don't need to create a hosting or a domain, all I need are the files, I prefer regular HTML and CSS for my site
 
The most important thing for me is the speed and quality of your work 
 
About payment - I pay directly 3500$ in bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency
 
Start doing your work. Make, for example, only header and carousel, then I will transfer you full prepayment in cryptocurrencyðŸ™ƒ
